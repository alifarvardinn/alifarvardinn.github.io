A boy who tries to understand the world, and finds his place in it. 



I am one of those people with a long list of hobbies but when it comes to the ones that I actually do, the list shrinks. I love riding my bike, my favorite
season for riding is probably winter and spring, especially on a snowy day or a rainy one. 

I also enjoy drawing and sketching. Mostly portraits, but also, I do like drawing perspective and wide-angle shots, they're the most tricky ones to draw.

Reading novels is my favorite guilt-free joy, cause I don't get that guilt that "You are wasting your time Ali, get a grip" every second in my head.

So, after those, I get to the most time-consuming one, which is Movies. Yup I am one of those movie nerds too, but my prime years are way past me, and I am
kinda retired lately in the movie hobby category :)



Apart from those, if I find a cozy and of course clean pool around, I would probably find myself swimming every day, but apparently, that's a luxury wish.
