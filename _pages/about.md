title: "About Me"
---

A boy who tries to understand the world, and finds his place in it. 


I've always been interested in nature and understanding how it functions, especially when we can exploit its energy and use it for our benefit. I had a blast working on solar desalination systems for my thesis. However, I have always been interested in working in the field of wind energy. I have recently focused on learning about atmospheric science, tidal winds, shaping clouds, and their role in harvesting wind energy. I haven't been this passionate about a subject for a long time, and I am not planning to stop. I want to continue and do my PhD in this field.



My Hobbies: 

I am one of those people with a long list of hobbies but when it comes to the ones that I actually do, the list shrinks. I love riding my bike, my favorite
season for riding is probably winter and spring, especially on a snowy day or a rainy one. 

I also enjoy drawing and sketching. Mostly portraits, but also, I do like drawing perspective and wide-angle shots, they're the most tricky ones to draw.

Reading novels is my favorite guilt-free joy, cause I don't get that guilt that "You are wasting your time Ali, get a grip" every second in my head.

So, after those, I get to the most time-consuming one, which is Movies. Yup I am one of those movie nerds too, but my prime years are way past me, and I am
kinda retired lately in the movie hobby category :)



Apart from those, if I find a cozy and of course clean pool around, I would probably find myself swimming every day, but apparently, that's a luxury wish.
